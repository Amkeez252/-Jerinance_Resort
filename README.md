# Jerinance Resort
<img src="./images/banner3.jpg" />
<p>The Online Hotel Booking System is my final project at ALX. The system is designed for Jerinance Suite. It is a web system that provides an environment for users to book rooms online via computers or phones. The system is a 3-tier-distributed architecture that displays the user interface to a Web browser using PHP. The middle tier is the Apache Web server that handles requests from the client Web browser and provides access to the third tier MySQL database.</p>
